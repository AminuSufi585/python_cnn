  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <div id="coursedesc">
    Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in which the connectivity pattern between neurons is inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex. Individual cortical neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the receptive field. The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they cover the entire visual field. I built network this using only <a target="_blank" href="http://www.numpy.org/">Numpy</a> and it has has multiple layers which makes it a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep learning</a>. I pluged the model to a Django App and used JavaScript to capture the input so it can be used as a web app. I pre-trained the model to save time.

    <h3> What the heck is CNNs for ? </h3>
    <p>
        Convolutional neural nets are a weird combination of biology and math together with CS, and these networks have been some of the most exciting innovations in the field of computer vision. Lots of big companies have been using deep learning(AKA deep neural net) at the core of their services.<br>
         Facebook uses neural nets for their automatic tagging algorithms, Google for their photo search, Amazon for their product recommendations, Pinterest for their home feed personalization, and Instagram for their search infrastructure. These networks also enable vision in robotics and driverless cars.<br>
        To understand convolutional neural networks (CNNs), you must first understand convolution. Wikipedia gives a good mathematical definition <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Why I did this</h3>
    <p>There a many machine learning libraries that simplify the maths and most of the challenges people fear about AI. Such packages as TensorFlow, Theano, Pytorch. But I always wanted to know how the abtractions these package have built in occur. I choose to learn the math and logic using just numpy, which is a very convenient package for matrix manipulation. I started with the Keras MNIST convolutional neural net <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">example</a> and then made modifications to create this project.</p>
